douglas adams’ artistic sensibility is both specific and elusive. he can go from distraught to delighted
in the space of a modifier. he combines lary larson’s irony, bill watterson’s wistful idealism,

what my mother told me when i was young.”
“why, what did she tell you?”
“i don’t know, i didn’t listen.”

5. he gazed keenly into the distance and looked as if he would quite like the wind to blow his hair
back dramatically at that point, but the wind was busy fooling around with some leaves a little way off.

6. don’t panic.
