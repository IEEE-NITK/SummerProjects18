put simply, chi (qi) is that which gives life. in terms of the body, chi is that which differentiates a corpse from a live human being.

to use a biblical reference, it is that which god breathed into the dust to produce adam. chi is also the basis of acupuncture.

a strong life force makes a human being totally alive, alert and present while a weak force results in sluggishness and fatigue. you can increase and develop your chi to overcome illness, become more vibrant and enhance mental capacity.

the concept of a life force is found in most of the ancient cultures of the world. in india, it is called prana; in china, chi; in japan, ki; for native americans, the great spirit. for all these cultures and others as well, the idea of life force is or was central to their forms of medicine and healing.
energy can be increased in a human being. consequently, the development of chi can make an ill person robust or a weak person vibrant. more chi can enhance mental capacity too.

the concept of chi also extends beyond the physical body, to the subtle energies that activate all human functions, including emotions and thought. unbalanced chi causes your emotions to become agitated and distressed. balanced chi causes your emotions to become smooth and more satisfying.

from the perspective of thought, when your mental chi becomes more refined it enhances your creativity at all levels--art, business, relationships, child rearing, etc.

spiritual chi makes it more possible for us to personally enter into higher states of consciousness, which lie at the heart of religious experience.

qigong, tai chi and other form of taoist martial and healing arts, help you to develop subtle chi-energy, not as an idea but rather lead you to directly feel and experience what this is in your body.
