modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary it is theoretically possible to break such a system but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means these schemes are therefore termed computationally secure theoretical advances eg improvements in integer factorization algorithms and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted there exist information0theoretically secure schemes that probably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power an example is the one time pad but these schemes are more difficult to implement than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms
