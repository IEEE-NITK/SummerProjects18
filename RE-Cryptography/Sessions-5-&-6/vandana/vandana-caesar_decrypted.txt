so the boy . . . the boy must die? asked snape 
quite calmly.
and voldemort himself must do it, severus. that is 
essential. 
another long silence. then snape said, i thought . . . 
all these 
years . . . that we were protecting him for her. for lily. 
we have 
protected him because it has been essential to teach him, 
to raise 
him, to let him try his strength, said dumbledore, his eyes 
still tight shut. meanwhile, the 
connection between them grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth: 
sometimes 
i have thought he suspects it himself. if i know him, he will have 
arranged 
matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will 
truly mean the end of voldemort. dumbledore opened his eyes. 
snape looked horrified. 
you have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment? 
don’t be 
shocked, severus. how many men and women have you watched die? 
lately, only 
those whom i could not save, said snape. he stood up. 
you have used me. meaning? 
i have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal 
danger for you. 
everything was supposed to be to keep lily potter’s son safe. now you tell 
me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter
