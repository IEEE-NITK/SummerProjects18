if you take away all the noise around cryptocurrencies and reduce it a to simple definition, you find it to be just limited entries in a database no one can change without fulfilling specific conditions. this may seem ordinary, but, believe it or not: this is exactly how you can define a currency.take the money on your bank account: what is it more than entries in a database that can only be changed under specific conditions? you can even take physical coins and notes: what are they else than limited entries in a public physical database that can only be changed if you match the condition than you physically own the coins and notes? money is all about a verified entry in some kind of database of accounts, balances, and transactions.
