# Assignment 1 - Phase 1
(Deadline: 20th June)

NOTE:- **We have paired you up for the next phase of this assignment. The work that you do now is individual work. DO NOT share any files, or any information with anyone (not even your partner).**

## General Instructions
- Consists of 3 sub-assignments.
- You will have to write computer programs (in any language) for encryption
- For all these assignments **use lower case english alphabets only** for message, key and cipher-text 
- Different messages for each of following encryptions is recommended.
- The message, key, cipher-text and program should be present in separate files. 
- The program can read message and key files and should output the cipher-text to another file. Do not store key or message in program file. 

## Steps to be followed:
1. Pull latest changes from GitHub.
2. Under RE-Cryptography/Sessions-5-&-6/ , create a folder Yourname/
3. All your files are to be placed in Yourname/
4. Refer Example/ for sample directory structure

### Questions

**Note: The message file and keyfile are text files. Either you store them inside _Yourname/_ and don't push those files to GitHub, or 
you store these files outside of the SummerProjects18 folder and access them by means of programming (recommended)**

- Caesar Encryption:
Write a program to encrypt a message(about 200 words, just pick some random paragraphs from somewhere) of your choice using Caesar cipher.
**The keyfile is not needed for this question** 
Name the:   
Program file as  yourname-caesar_encryption.extension  
and  
Cipher-text file as yourname-caesar_ciphertext.txt  



- Vigenere Encryption: 
Write a program to encrypt a message(about 200 words, just pick some random paragraphs from somewhere) of your choice using Vigenere cipher. 

Name the 
Program file as yourname-vigenere_encryption.extension  
and  
Cipher-text file as yourname-vigenere_ciphertext.txt  

- Substitution Encryption:
Write a program to encrypt a message(just one meaningful word of 7 letters) of your choice using Substitution cipher. 
Name the:  
Program file as yourname-substitution_encryption.extension  
and   
Cipher-text file as yourname-substitution_ciphertext.txt


### Message and Keyfiles

Make sure you have these saved somewhere for the next phase of the Assignment. **DO NOT** push the message and keyfiles to GitHub.

Name them using this convention (No keyfile for Caesar's needed):
yourname-message-caesar.txt
yourname-keyfile-vigenere.txt
and so on.

**Good Luck!**
