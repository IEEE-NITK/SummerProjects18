the dursleys had everything they wanted,but they also had a secret,and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.they didn't think they could bear it if anyone found about the potters.mrs.potter was mr.dursley's sister,but they hadn't met for years;in fact,mrs.dursley pretended she didn't have a sister,because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be.the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbours would say if the potters arrived in the street.the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son,too,but they had never seen him.this boy was another reason for keeping the potters away,they didn't want dudley mixing with a child like that.
