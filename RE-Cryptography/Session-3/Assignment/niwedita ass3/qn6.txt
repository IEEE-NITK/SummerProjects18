a) code6 outputs {0-(n-1)& OUtput=n} , if n is given as input.
EX.:Enter a number: 3
    1
    2
    Output = 3

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int n;
	printf("Enter a number:");
	scanf("%d",&n);
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		printf("%d\n",i);
	printf("Output = %d\n",n);
	return 0;
}



b) It's not same.  code6 uses a function called call_me_1() to print the nummbers less than the input.

c) Functions in code6: printf, scanf, call_me_1(), call_me_2()

  construction of stack frame :
  push rbp
  mov rbp, rsp
  sub rsp, 0x10

  Destruction of stack frame: 
  leave
  ret


 d) nop is the command that does nothing. 
 It is most commonly used for time delays.
