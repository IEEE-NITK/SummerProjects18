a)  warning: implicit declaration of function ‘gets’; did you mean ‘fgets’? [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
    warning: the `gets' function is dangerous and should not be used.

b) 0x400566 is the rbp value pushed at the beginning of the main function.
   0x000000000040059b is the return address of the main function.

c) any input of more than 119 characters gives segmentation fault.

d) once the length of input exceeds the size of the buffer, the extra length of the input could be overwriting the return address of main
that can cause a segfault

e) Any input of length pf at least 120 can give a segfault.

   From gdb, it is seen that, rsp moves done by 0x70 bytes, i.e 112 bytes. And the return adddress of main is of 64bits, hence 8bytes long.
   112+20 = 120, hence once this limit is reached the return address of main is fully overwritten, causing a segfault.
