a) n=10
Iterative : no. of instruction =105
            stack space used = 135168
Recursive: instructions = 161
            stack space = 135168

Stack space used by both are same by static analysis. 

b) General formula for Iterative = 5+ 9n
                       Recursive = 1+16n

  n | iterative | recursive
  7        68         113
  4        41         65
  3        32         49
  2        23         33
  1        14         17 


c) Iterative is more efficient as it requires less no. of instructions.
