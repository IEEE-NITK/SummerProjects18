    mov rax, 0x04

    mov rcx, m2
    mov rdx, lenM2
    int 0x80

    mov rax, 0x01

c) from disass main, the compiler has used rbp, rsp to maintain the stack frame for main function. nut in my code , i printed directly using sys_write.

d) The compiler has converted the printf() function in the code to puts() function as a part
of its optimization of code, and also removed the second print statement.
