a) there was no difference in the output. the out put was - Hello world by code2_1!!

b)differences
code2-1                code 2-2               code2-3:

dynamically linked    statically linked       dynamically linked
not stripped           not stripped            stripped


c)in statically linked files, external programs are built into the executable 
files and they are larger in size.but in case of dynamic linking only one copy
 of shared library is kept in memory and it reduces the size of the executable
 program.

d-)in a stripped executable, the strip program removes inessential information 
   which might include debugging information .
   -the word stripped in encounterd in this analalysis
