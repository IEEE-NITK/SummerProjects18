a) when a number n is entered,output is-- 0 to n-1 printed each on different
lines and 'Output=n' is printed.
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{int i=0,n;
scanf("%d",&n);
{for (i=0;i<n;i+=1)
	printf("%d\n" ,i);}
printf("Output=%d",n);

}


b)they are different. call-me-1 is recursively called to print numbers and call-me-2 stores the input number and the control is passed back to main to print the output

c)construction of the stack frame-
push rbp
mov rbp, rsp
sub rsp, 0x10
destruction-
mov rbp,rsp
pop rbp





d) nop instruction does nothing.no registers are affected by this.
it was found in code6.
