a.)   the executable runs on an ARM architecture[32 bit].This i found out using the file command.'file code1' prints out the following resultode1:'' ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=064c747a31c5291ef61bc2046b820d335582c1a0, not stripped''

b)Magic numbers are the first bits of a file which uniquely identify the type of file.
magic number of this executable is 7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00

c)when trying to run the pdf file using the command ./code1, it gave the error
+'bash: ./re-assignment2.pdf: Permission denied'
even when using the command chmod , error 'no job control' was printed.

d )pdf cant be run as an executable. as the magic number of the pdf is different from the executable file, it wont be run as an executable.
