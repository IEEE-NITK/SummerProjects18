a) the output is- This statement should get printed!
This again will get printed!
first printf statement gets executed in this program and then a goto statement i
is encountered and the control jumps to label1.so the second printf statement 
is skipped and the third printf statement gets executed.
--this is run and gives the intended output
b)section .text
global _start
_start:
	mov rax, 0x04
	mov rbx, 0x01
	mov rcx, msg1
	mov rdx, len1
	int 80h
	 
	jmp label
	
	mov rax, 0x04
	mov rbx, 0x01
	mov rcx, msg2
	mov rdx, len2
	int 0x80
label:
	mov rax, 0x04
	mov rbx, 0x01
	mov rcx, msg3
	mov rdx, len3
	int 0x80

	mov rax, 0x01
	mov rbx, 0x00
	int 0x80
section .data
msg1 db "This statement should get printed",0x0a
msg2 db "This statement should not get printed",0x0a
msg3 db "This again will get printed",0x0a
len1 equ $-msg1
len2 equ $-msg2
len3 equ $-msg3


c.   code3 is a dynamically inked executable. the code ive written produces  a statically linked executable.and the second printf is removed as its inessential



d) inesential parts like the second printf statement is removed by the compiler.
