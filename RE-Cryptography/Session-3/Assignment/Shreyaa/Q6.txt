the user is required to input a number.THe output given is:

numbers till the inputted number are printed in a new line and finally output=input number is printed


c program:

#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
printf("Enter a number: ");
int n;
scanf("%d",&n);
int i;
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
{
printf("%d\n",i);
}
printf("Output = %d \n",n);
}

NO,they're not the same.code6 uses a recursive function call_me_1 which prints the numbers from 0 to the number before the entered number. another function call_me_2 loads the value of entered number into eax and returns control to main,to print the number.

6c.the functions present in code6 are main,call_me_1, and call_me_2.


construction of stack frame:
push   rbp
mov    rbp,rsp
sub    rsp,0x10
destruction of stack frame:
mov rbp,rsp
pop rbp

6d.a nop instruction,short for no operation,is an assembly language instruction,that does nothing.yes,there is a nop instruction in function call_me_1.
