2a. I did not find any difference in the output of the three files.

2b.code2_1 is a 64-bit LSB executable,which is dynamically linked and is not stripped.

code2_2 is a 64-bit LSB executable,which is statically linked and not stripped.

code2_3 is a 64-bit LSB executable,which is dynamically linked and stripped.


2c. Static linking involves the linker copying all library routines used in the program into the executable image,hence it requires more disk space and memory.
Dynamic linking however,is accomplished by placing the name of a shareable library in the executable image.Actual linking with the library routine does not occur until the image is run,when both the executable and the library are placed in memory

2d. When the file command was run,it reported that code2_1 and code2_2  were  not stripped,whereas code2_3 was stripped.A stripped executable file is one in which all the debugging symbols have been removed,thus reducing the size of the file.
iwhen the disassembly of the main function was found for all 3 files,code2_1 and code2_2 gave the disassembly  of mainn function whereas for code2_3 the following output was given:
gdb-peda$ disass main
No symbol table is loaded.  Use the "file" command.
