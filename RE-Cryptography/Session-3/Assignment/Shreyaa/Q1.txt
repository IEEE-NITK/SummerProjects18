1b. Magic number is a constant numerical value or text value used to identify a file format or protocol. The magic number of code1 executable file is 7f45 4c46 0101 0100.

1c. I tried running re-assignment2.pdf as an executable file and got the following output:

[comment by Adwaith]: Try giving executable permissions(chmod u+x re-assignment2.pdf) and run it.

1d.The magic numbers of an executable file and a pdf file are not the same,hence they cannot be run in the same format.Therefore,a pdf file cannot be run as an executable file.
