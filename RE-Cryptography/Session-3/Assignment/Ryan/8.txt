Stack space= 139264
No. of assembly instructions executed= 105


For factorial_rec:

Stack space= 139264
No. of assembly instructions executed= 225


b.

i) For factorial_iter:
No. of assembly instructions executed= 9n+15

For factorial_rec:
No. of assembly instructions executed= 23n-5

ii)Stack Space = 139264

c.
Iterative version is better based on no. of instructions.
