a) for input of length >= 120, segfault occurs

b) for length >= 108 causes segfault.

c) when compiled with -fno-stack-protector,
  error is Segmentation fault (core dumped)

  when compiled normally.
  *** stack smashing detected ***: <unknown> terminated
  Aborted (core dumped)

d)
  in code12_2, the segment register fs is used in func1 and a function stack_chk_fail is called
    before func1 return control to main. These two aren't present in code12_1

e) The segment registers are used to guard the stack.
  They are used to check if the function has attempted to write beyond its stack frame that can cause segfaults.

g) gdb didn't allow me to access the value fs.
  0x555555554717 <func1+8>:	mov    rax,QWORD PTR fs:0x28
  0x555555554720 <func1+17>:	mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],rax

  I used gdp-peda$: x/s $rax to get the value of f:0x28, but was denied access.
  When I used gdp-peda$: x/s $rbp-0x8, the output was 0x7fffffffdd68:	""
