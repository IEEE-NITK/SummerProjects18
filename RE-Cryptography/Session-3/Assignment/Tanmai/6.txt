a) code 6 outputs numbers from 0 to n-1 where n is the integer that is given as input

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int n;
  printf("enter a number: "); scanf("%d", &n);
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) printf("%d\n", n);
  return 0;
}

b) It's not the same. code6 uses a function called call_me_1() to print the nummbers less than the input

c) The functions in cod6 are printf, scanf, call_me_1(), call_me_2()
construction of a stack frame push rbp ; mov rbp, rsp
destruction happens when ret is used

d) nop means no operation, it's an instruction that does nothing.
 It can be used for time delays.
