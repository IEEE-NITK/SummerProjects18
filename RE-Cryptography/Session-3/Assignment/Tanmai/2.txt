a) All the 3 files produce the same output which is 'Hello world by code2_1!!'

b) All 64bit programs.
  code2_1 : dynamically linked, not stripped
  code2_2 : statically linked, not stripped
  code2_3 : dynamically linked, stripped

  A plausible reason as to why code2_2 is much bigger than code2_1 is because code2_2 is statically linked whereas
  code2_1 is dynamically linked.

  Static linking is the result of the linker copying all library routines used in the program into the executable image. This may require
  more disk space and memory than dynamic linking, but is both faster and more portable,since it does not require the presence of the library on the system where it is run.

  Dynamic linking is accomplished by placing the name of a sharable library in the executable image. Actual linking with the library routines does not occur until the image is run.
  Hence dynamic linking occupies lesser space.

c) Stripped executable means it has no debugging information and other data included in the executable like name of variables, functions, etc that helps reduce the size of the program.
  code2_1 is not stripped, but code2_3 is stripped.
