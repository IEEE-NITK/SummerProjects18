a) code9 prints the first arg that is passed to it. (only when no. of args == 2).

d)
  return address of print_buffer =0x00005555555547ae
  rbp is at 0x7fffffffdd50
  by dynamic analysis = 0x00005555555547ae

  The return address is the same from both the analyses

  On giving an input of length > 100 gives a segmentation fault in the output
