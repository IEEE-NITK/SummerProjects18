c) from disass main, the compiler has used rbp, rsp to maintain the stack frame for
  the main function whereas in y assembly code I have directly printed the strings using
  sys_write without any stack.

d) The compiler has converted the printf() function in the code to puts() function as a part
  of its optimization of code, and also removed the second print statement
