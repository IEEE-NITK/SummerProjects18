a)  n = 10
  Iterative: no.of instructions = 105
             stack space used = 135168
  recursive: instructions = 161
            stack space = 135168

*** stack space used by both were same, my understanding is that recursive approach requires more stack space.
But I wasn't able to figurue out why both were occupying the same size. (from the maps file). ***

b) General formula for Iterative = 5 + 9n
                      recursive = 1 + 16n

    n | iterative | recursive
    7        68         113
    4        41         65
    3        32         49
    2        23         33
    1        14         17
c) Iterative is more efficient than the recursive approach since it requires lesser instructions.
