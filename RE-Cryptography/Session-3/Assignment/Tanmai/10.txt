a) warning: implicit declaration of function ‘gets’; did you mean ‘fgets’? [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
    warning: the `gets' function is dangerous and should not be used.
b)
    rbp = 0x7fffffffdd80
    return addr = 0x5555555546c1

c) any input of length >= 120 will give a segfault

d)once the length of input exceeds the size of the buffer, the extra length of the input could be overwriting the return address of main
  that can cause a segfault

e)Any input of length pf at least 120 can give a segfault.

  From gdb, it is seen that, rsp moves done by 0x70 bytes, i.e 112 bytes. And the return adddress of main is of 64bits, hence 8bytes long.
  112+20 = 120, hence once this limit is reached the return address of main is fully overwritten, causing a segfault.
