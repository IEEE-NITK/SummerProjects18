Message: Hey guys!

#9 User:UAFVAN945
Message: How is your vacation going so far?

#10 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: pretty good

#11 User:UAFVAN945
Message: That's nice!

#12 User:UAFVAN945
Message: So let's begin

#13 User:UAFVAN945
Message: You have worked with the vi editor in first year right?

#14 User:UAFVAN945
Message: So, there are so many text editors available like Vim, emacs, Sublime Text, Atom etc.

#15 User:UAFVAN945
Message: You need to figure out which one works best for you.

#16 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Vim and emacs are popular text editors that are installed by default on most Linux distributions and they both have their pros and cons. If you want to get around your system like a ninja, you'll need to pick up one of these text editors to use. They are essentially coding, word document processing and basically all in one editors.

#17 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: all of these are in-built?

#18 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Vi is there by default, you need to install the others. I do recommend Sublime text, that's the one I found most comfortable working with.

#19 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: ohk

#20 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Vim stands for vi (Improved) just like its name it stands for an improved version of the vi text editor command.

It's super lightweight, opening and editing a file with vim is quick and easy. It's also almost always available, if you booted up a random Linux distribution, chances are vim is installed by default.

#21 User:UAFVAN945
Message: So today we will learn about the vi editor.

#22 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Ready?

#23 User:UAFVAN945
Message: So I want you guys to open up your terminal and then make a text file called "practise.txt"

#24 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFVAN945> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/UAFVAN945/FBJSJ3H2N/-.js|Untitled>

#25 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Once you are done with that, click on 'i' to enter into the insert mode and then type in the following text:

#27 User:UAFU0J1K5
Message: <@UAFU0J1K5> has joined the channel

#28 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Now what we're first going to learn is how to search for the first occurrence of the word sky

#29 User:UAFVAN945
Message: so in order to do that we need to first hit the Esc key

#30 User:UAFVAN945
Message: This takes it back to the command mode.

#31 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Then to search we say '/sky'

#32 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Once you hit enter, you can press "n" to go forward or "N" to go backward in your search results.

#33 User:UAFVAN945
Message: The '?' search command will search the text file backwards, so in the previous example, the last pretty would come up first.

#34 User:UAFVAN945
Message: So try that out as well. Type '?sky' to see the last occurrence of the word.

#35 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Like you just tried out with the "n" and "N" keys, in order to navigate in vim

#36 User:UAFVAN945
Message: there are special keys

#37 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFVAN945> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/UAFVAN945/FBKUS8WQP/-.txt|Untitled>

#38 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Enter few more lines with separate lines and try this out.

#39 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFPA8G59> Which key would you use to get into insert mode?

#40 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: i

#41 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFLHAB2M> How would you go back to the command mode from insert mode?

#42 User:UAH8CT90X
Message: :wq?

#43 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: Esc

#44 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAH8CT90X> ':wq' is to save and exit the editor.

#45 User:UAFVAN945
Message: 'i' isn't the only key to enter into the insert mode.

#46 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Based on where you want the text to be entered. There are other keys you can use like:

#47 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFVAN945> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/UAFVAN945/FBKRR9G22/-.txt|Untitled>

#48 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Can all of you try to enter the text "Good Evening!" above the current first line?

#49 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFU0J1K5> can you tell us how you did that? What keys did you use?

#50 User:UAFU0J1K5
Message: O

#51 User:UAFVAN945
Message: I want all of you to practice using these various modes once the session is over. Cool?

#52 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: sorry. shut down due to battery drain

#53 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Now say you have made a mistake and you want to edit the text. Does the backspace work?

#54 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: yep esc

#55 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: It works only in insert mode

#56 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: while in insert mode, yes

#57 User:UAFVAN945
Message: good

#58 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFVAN945> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/UAFVAN945/FBJB1403B/-.txt|Untitled>

#59 User:UAFVAN945
Message: These are the keys you would use for text editing.

#60 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Can you try to copy the first line and paste it thrice?

#61 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFPA8G59> how did you do it?

#62 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: For me 'p' pasted text on a new line rather than pasting it just before the cursor

#63 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: I put the cursor on that line, pressed yy,went to the end and pressed p thrice

#64 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: same

#65 User:UAFVAN945
Message: yeah same:sweat_smile:. The paste functionality automatically pastes in the new line

#66 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Since a line has been copied, it pastes as a new line

#67 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: so p pastes the copied text in the line after the cursor?

#68 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Good job!

#69 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Everyone with me?

#70 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Something you need to keep in mind is '^' key will move the cursor to the  first non-blank character of the line

#71 User:UAFVAN945
Message: and the"$" moves to the end of the line

#72 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html>

#73 User:UAFVAN945
Message: This website is a good resource for basic vi commands.

#74 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Now it's time to learn about how the boot process takes place.

#75 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Have you heard the phrase "booting the system"?

#76 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: vimtutor command also has the same thing i think

#77 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFPA8G59> what does booting the system mean?

#78 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: loading the system from rom to ram ??

#79 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: basically starting it up

#80 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Good answer!

#81 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: procedure for initializing the system

#82 User:UAFVAN945
Message: awesome!

#83 User:UAFVAN945
Message: When you turn on your machine, it does some neat things like show you the logo screen, run through some different messages and then at the end you're prompted with a login window. Well there is actually a ton of stuff happening between when you push the power button to when you login.

#84 User:UAFVAN945
Message: The Linux boot process can be broken down in 4 simple stages:

#85 User:UAFVAN945
Message: *1. BIOS*
The BIOS (stands for "Basic Input/Output System") initializes the hardware and makes sure with a Power-on self test (POST) that all the hardware is good to go. The main job of the BIOS is to load up the bootloader.

#86 User:UAFVAN945
Message: *2. Bootloader*
The bootloader loads the kernel into memory and then starts the kernel with a set of kernel parameters. One of the most common bootloaders is GRUB, which is a universal Linux standard.

#87 User:UAFVAN945
Message: *3. Kernel*
When the kernel is loaded, it immediately initializes devices and memory. The main job of the kernel is to load up the init process.

#88 User:UAFVAN945
Message: *4. Init*
Remember the init process is the first process that gets started, init starts and stops essential service process on the system. There are three major implementations of init in Linux distributions.

#89 User:UAFVAN945
Message: There it is, the (very) simple explanation of the Linux boot process.

#90 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Everyone with me?

#91 User:UAFVAN945
Message: How many of you have dual-booted your system?

#92 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: means using 2 operating system?

#93 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: like windows and ubuntu?

#94 User:UAFVAN945
Message: correct

#95 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Have any of you seen the GRUB menu?

#96 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFVAN945> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/UAFVAN945/FBKVA9PHD/grub2-in-ubuntu.jpg|grub2-in-ubuntu.jpg>

#97 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: nope. I'm using VMware Workstation for ubuntu

#98 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFLHAB2M> that's alright

#99 User:UAFVAN945
Message: This what a GRUB menu looks like,  when you dual boot your system. You get to choose which OS you want to boot into

#100 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Let's go into a little more detail of the booting process

#101 User:UAFVAN945
Message: BIOS- The first step in the Linux boot process is the BIOS which performs system integrity checks. The BIOS is a firmware that comes most common in IBM PC compatible computers, the dominant type of computers out there today. The BIOS's main goal is to find the system bootloader.

So once the BIOS boots up the hard drive, it searches for the boot block to figure out how to boot up the system. Depending on how you partition your disk, it will look to the master boot record (MBR). The MBR is located in the first sector of the hard drive, the first 512 bytes. The MBR contains the code to load another program somewhere on the disk, this program in turn actually loads up our bootloader.

#102 User:UAFVAN945
Message: The bootloader's main responsibilities are:
-Booting into an operating system, it can also be used to boot to non-Linux operating systems
-Select a kernel to use
-Specify kernel parameters

#103 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Everyone with me?

#104 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Have you guys heard the term "kernel" before?

#105 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFLHAB2M> can you tell what you know?

#106 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: i dont know properly. its acts as some interface between us and cpu

#107 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: initializes and configures the computer’s memory and also configures all the hardware attached to the system

#108 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAH8CT90X> what is the functionality of the kernel?

#109 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFLHAB2M> good attempt!

#110 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFVAN945> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/UAFVAN945/FBJTCK2QJ/kernel_layout.svg.png|Kernel_Layout.svg.png> and commented: In operating system, the kernel is a computer program that manages input/output requests from software, and translates them into data processing instructions for the central processing unit and other electronic components of a computer.

#111 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: <@UAFL06YEM> has joined the channel

#112 User:UAFVAN945
Message: The kernel is a fundamental part of a modern computer’s operating system
• The critical code of the kernel is usually loaded into a protected area of memory, which prevents it from being overwritten by other, less frequently used parts of the operating system or by applications.
 • The kernel performs its tasks, such as executing processes and handling interrupts, in kernel space, whereas everything a user normally does, such as writing text in a text editor or running programs in a GUI (graphical user interface), is done in user space.

#113 User:UAFVAN945
Message: So, in other words Kernel is like the brain:smile:

#114 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Guys just a few more minutes and we'll wrap up the session. I do want to tell you guys about the project too.

#115 User:UAFVAN945
Message: So the last topic for today's session is 'Init' process

#116 User:UAFVAN945
Message: *System V init (sysv)*
This is the traditional init system. It sequentially starts and stops processes, based on startup scripts.
*Upstart*
This is the init you'll find on older Ubuntu installations. Upstart uses the idea of jobs and events and works by starting jobs that performs certain actions in response to events.

*Systemd*
This is the new standard for init, it is goal oriented. Basically you have a goal that you want to achieve and systemd tries to satisfy the goal's dependencies to complete the goal.

#117 User:UAFVAN945
Message: So now regarding the project, we would like you guys to pair up and think of a project idea that you find interesting or as an application of everything you have learned so far in this course.

#118 User:UAFVAN945
Message: In case you can't think of an idea, you can ping any one of us and we will help you out. You have 2 weeks to do the project.

#119 User:UAFVAN945
Message: It will be evaluated in the first week of August.

#120 User:UAFVAN945
Message: So that's it for today's session guys!

#121 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: upto when this SMP will go on?

#122 User:UAFVAN945
Message: End of July

#123 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: ok

#124 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Bye:wave:

#125 User:UAH8CT90X
Message: hey sorry my internet was out

#126 User:UAH8CT90X
Message: a kernel is basically used to communicate the commands to the shell
