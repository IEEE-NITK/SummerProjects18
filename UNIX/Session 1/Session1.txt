Message: okay let us start now

#16 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: do all of you have a terminal to begin with?

#17 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: it would be nice to explore the commands on the go. Please make sure you have this for future sessions atleast

#18 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: most of what I cover today, is what you already know

#19 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: okay, can anyone tell me what ls does?

#20 User:Aniketh
Message: what is the full form?

#21 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: list is the full form of ls

#22 User:Aniketh
Message: oh my bad. Yes ls lists all the files in the present directory

#23 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: there are tons of other options that can be used along with ls

#24 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: for instance:

#25 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: <@abhiram chowdary> can you tell me what ls -l does?

#26 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: how is it different from the barebones ls?

#27 User:abhiram chowdary
Message: It gives a long formate like it include last time used etc

#28 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: yeah. more precisely, it mentions the size, permissions, modified date and time, owner of the file, etc.

#29 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: To see the filesize in human readable format, we can use ls -lh command

#30 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: <@Yash Khivasara> what does ls -a do?

#31 User:Aniketh
Message: sorry but what is barebones?

#32 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: -h flag stands for human readable

#33 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: without any flag, only the ls command

#37 User:Ayush Arun Singh
Message: Is it?

#38 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: <@Ankit Karody> can you tell me what ls -R does? Do this in a directory with subdirectories :stuck_out_tongue:

#39 User:abhiram chowdary
Message: Even LS -a mentions current and prarent directory's

#40 User:Ankit Karody
Message: lists recursively directory tree

#41 User:abhiram chowdary
Message: Also

#42 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: yeah. Folders might contain many hidden files (usually beginning with a dot in their names, like .bashrc, .vimrc, .profile) etc.

#43 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: yeah, correct

#44 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: A better way to visualize the directory structure is by using tree command. But you will have to install the program in the first place

#45 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: okay, let's move onto the cd command

#46 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: cd as you know, is used to change the working directory

#47 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: you all must check out zsh terminal

#48 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: there's a nice plugin called oh-my-zsh also

#49 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: it's really cool

#50 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: <@Nakul Suresh> has joined the channel

#51 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: now, can everyone pitch in the different ways we can use cd command?

#52 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: like moving to parent folder, ... etc?

#53 User:Akshay Gupta
Message: <@Akshay Gupta> has joined the channel

#54 User:Ayush Arun Singh
Message: cd~username does that i guess

#55 User:Rosa Anil George
Message: It is important that ls is in lowercase as LS isn't a command

#56 User:Ankit Karody
Message: cd .. moves up one directory

#57 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: moving to the home directory can be done using "cd ~ "

#58 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: but moving one directory above needs : cd ..

#59 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: yeah

#60 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: how do you move up two directories at a time?

#61 User:Ankit Karody
Message: cd ../..

#62 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: yeah, correct

#63 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: As an aside, in the zsh terminal with that plugin, you can directly start typing in the folder name, it will have cached all of the previous working directories. It's a great productivity boost for devs.

#64 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: is everyone with me so far?

#65 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: any doubts?

#66 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: is zsh a separate program

#67 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: you can tell me if I am fast, slow, boring, whatever

#68 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: it's another terminal itself, like bash

#69 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: so we have to install zsh right

#71 User:Aniketh
Message: Do all terminals need Linux OS?

#72 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: terminal is a program on the linux distributions, which can be used to create, manage and work with other processes

#73 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: now, you have terminals on windows also, apart from mac OSX

#74 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: okay, moving on. Can anyone tell me what's the different between relative and absolute address?

#75 User:Ankit Karody
Message: relative address is dealing with memory locations with respect to another one

#76 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: you can use bash on windows also, but you don't have the freedom to tinker with stuff, like you do in linux

#77 User:Ayush Arun Singh
Message: Relative addresses can be diff

#78 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: windows abstracts away a lot of the details from the user

#79 User:Ayush Arun Singh
Message: But absolute address is same no matter which directory u working in

#80 User:Ankit Karody
Message: like if you have a pointer p pointing to a int and p++ will point to the address + 4bytes

#81 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: correct, absolute addresses are specified from the root directory

#82 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: the relative addresses are specified wrt the current directory

#83 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: I am not sure if the pointers analogy is the best way to describe the situation. Especially, when we have soft links and all

#84 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: you guys can check out what "cd - " does

#85 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: it's used to move directly to the last used directory

#86 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: okay, shall we move on to pwd command?

#87 User:abhiram chowdary
Message: S

#88 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: can we use pointers to  access and manipulate these addresses?

#89 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: <@Chenna Keshava> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/Chenna Keshava/FAGJCLE13/code_for_pwd.sh|code for pwd>


#91 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: can we type cd ../../ n times to move up n directories?

#92 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: I am not sure I got your question, but yeah that's how it's implemented in the file system

#93 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: the commands to create a file, create soft and hard links, delete a file - all involving storing the addresses of blocks of memory(which together make up a file)

#94 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: storing and playing with the addresses of the blocks

#95 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: but these are not exposed to the user per se, that's why we need an abstraction called a file system


#97 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: so what does pwd do? - spits out the present working directory


#99 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: 4th one gives the home directory i guess


#101 User:Ankit Karody
Message: ln: ./a: File exists

#102 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: so the first line will take you to the home directory


#104 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: the second line uses the ln with -s flag. It's used to create a soft link to the directory, which is specified in the first argument

#105 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: the third line moves into the htm directory


#107 User:abhiram chowdary
Message: What is soft link

#108 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: I took the pain of creating sym links or soft links to show the difference between -P and -L flags for the pwd command

#109 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: <@Aniketh> think of a terminal as just another program allowing you to do a bunch of stuff. Back in the day, there was no GUI. No mouse even at one point. So everything was done by issuing a specific set of commands to your computer. Everything from file handling to system management. And all of that was done through an interface called the Command Line Interface(CLI) which we now call the terminal. You can do everything you can do using a GUI on a terminal.

And no. You don't need a Linux OS for a terminal. Every major OS has a terminal, though the instructions you issue and what you can do has its limitations.

#110 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: soft links will be covered in detail in the future sessions. But what can be understood is - two different files can be linked together keeping a single copy of the data on the hard disk

#111 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: For e.g on the windows command line you have `dir` command to list directories and files whereas Linux bash terminals use `ls`

#112 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: something like a pointer?

#113 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: yeah, it's actually a pointer

#114 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: so pwd -L flag will only show the output, without minding the soft links

#115 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: but you will get a different output if you use a -P flag for the pwd command

#116 User:Aniketh
Message: thanks a lot

#117 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: also, I have used /bin/pwd command in the above snippet because, pwd refers to the shell's implementation of the command

#118 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: but /bin/pwd refers to the specific binary file, which is already present in the system

#119 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message:  <@Nakul Suresh> If there are n directories to move up to, then yes.

If you type `ls - a` in any directory it will list all the files and directories including the hidden ones. You will find two files `. ` and `.. `. Here the first one refers to the current directory and the second one to the parent directory.

#120 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: so when you are writing an application, if you don't want your applucation to break, when the bash implementation of pwd is modified, you will want to use binary implementations

#121 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: So you can keep doing `../../..` n number of times because every directory has a `.. ` that points to the parent directory.

#122 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: it's fine if you don't get the soft link part completely, just remember that we have flags to get the resolved path names also

#123 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: everyone is with me till now?

#124 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: Keep asking doubts :D

#125 User:Ayush Arun Singh
Message: Ya

#126 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: kinda

#127 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: hmm i see. and how to move down n directories?

#128 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: <@Chenna Keshava> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/Chenna Keshava/FAGJNP5K7/cat_command_usage.sh|cat command usage>

#129 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: I want you guys to try out all these commands

#130 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: the -n flag is used to include line numbers when it displays the contents of the files - improves readability

#131 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: <@abhiram chowdary> Remember creating a shortcut in windows? Think of it as a something pretty much like that. More details will be given in future sessions.

#132 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: the sixth line shows, how all the output of the cat command can be plummeled into another file. this is very useful

#133 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: <@Nakul Suresh> what's the doubt?

#134 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: for the command shown in the 4th line: we can take input from STDIN (keyboard) until the user hits Ctrl+D. All of that text will be saved into the specified file

#135 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: anything that you didn't understand here?

#136 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: cat is actually used to concatenate files. It concatenates them and prints an o/p

#137 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: What he's trying to say is, if you application uses the pwd command, if the version that bash uses is modified then your application might break. So we specifically tell it use the binary at /bin/pwd

#138 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: I've to look up some of this in order to get a clear picture that's all

#139 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: give me a thumbs up if you have understood.

#140 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: Yeah. Just raise doubts in the Google group if some doubt pops up. It's usually a bit murky in the beginning



#143 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: Create file with some dummy content first. And then run those commands.

#144 User:abhiram chowdary
Message: no










#154 User:Rosa Anil George
Message: cat is for display

#155 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: OK small question for you guys

#156 User:Rosa Anil George
Message: You could also say cat &lt; filename

#157 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: Let's say you have a file file1.txt with some text in it. There's another file file2.txt. How would you append the contents of file1.txt at the end of file2.txt?


#159 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: Move down as in?

#160 User:Ankit Karody
Message: cat file2.txt file1.txt




#164 User:abhiram chowdary
Message: is third command changes any of file original contents

#165 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: Are you sure? Wouldn't that just print the contents of file1 and then file2?
Read the question again

#166 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: it overwrites them

#167 User:abhiram chowdary
Message: means

#168 User:Rosa Anil George
Message: deletes the current content and adds the new one

#169 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: whatever was wriiten in the file at first will be replaced with whatever u just typed

#170 User:abhiram chowdary
Message: ohh

#171 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: So
`cat file1&gt;file2` will overwrite file2 with contents of file1

`cat file1&gt;&gt;file2` will append contents of file2 at the end of file1.


This is best seen when you type them out in a terminal yourself. So at the end of this I want all of you to run all of these on your terminals and to confirm the functionalities. You can raise doubts if something doesn't look right.

#172 User:Ayush Arun Singh
Message: :+1:

#173 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: works

#174 User:Ankit Karody
Message: oh yeah

#175 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: Question unanswered. 

#176 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: so, do you want me to continue?

#177 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: cat file2&gt;&gt;file

#178 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: or shall we call it a day?

#179 User:abhiram chowdary
Message: cat file1.txt file2.txt &gt;&gt;file2.txt

#180 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: What would that do? Can you go through it one by one by breaking it down?

#181 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: Sure? :p

#182 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: pretty sure

#183 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: I want to add thing to the end of file2, so should file2 be on the left of the &gt;&gt; or the right?

#184 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: left

#185 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: Also, when you see something like `command file1 &gt; file2`

contents of file1 will be used by the command and the output will be written to file2 by overwriting the current contents of file2. Cool?

#186 User:abhiram chowdary
Message: its actually cat file1.txt &gt;&gt;file2.txt

#187 User:abhiram chowdary
Message: s

#188 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: oh that's a good way to remember

#189 User:Ankit Karody
Message: cat file1&gt;&gt;file2 appends file1 to file2 right?

#190 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: The answer is `cat file1.txt&gt;&gt;file2.txt`

Breaking it down

`cat file1.txt` display content so file1.txt.
`cat file1.txt &gt;&gt;file2.txt` display contents of file1.txt and redirect it to the end of file2.txt (append)

#191 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: <@Ankit Karody> you are right.

#192 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: oh its the reverse

#193 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: `&gt;` is known as the redirection. If you notice cat only displays the output. The reason it gets added to file2 is because you `redirect` the output there?

#194 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: So if you break down the command `cat file1 &gt; file2`

It's actually made of two parts.

First part `cat file1` displays contents of file1

Second part `&gt; file2` redirect output of the command that preceded the `&gt;` to file2

#195 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: So you can actually do `ls&gt;file2`

#196 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: What do you think that will do?

#197 User:abhiram chowdary
Message: write the output given by ls to file

#198 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: yeah same

#199 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: Perfect. So next time you see a `&gt;`you should realize it just means take the output from what preceeded `&gt;` and redirect it to the file specified after `&gt;`

#200 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: okay, I managed to compile a few resources on other commands, just check them out

#205 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: Also, you can always do `command --help` and the terminal will display info about that command.

#206 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: Try with `ls --help` and `cat - - help`

#207 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: use the `man command_name` to get the manual pages

#208 User:Rosa Anil George
Message: Guys you can ping any of us if you have any doubts, you could post them either here or on the google group

#209 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: also, regarding the working of rm command, rm will only unlink the associated data from the file name in the filesystem, and it marks the associated space as usable on the device. We won't actually get rid of the data on the disk

#210 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: so, to remove stuff like your browser history, use shred command instead. This will overwrite all of the data on the disk, and so it can't be reconstructed again also.

#211 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
Message: We will come to this later ^

#212 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: okay, in conclusion, today we went through the commands ls, cat, pwd, cd, redirection operator

#213 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: okay, that's it for today

#214 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: you guys can ask your doubts on google groups - it's a lot more organised.

#215 User:Chenna Keshava
Message: good night!

#216 User:Kaushik S Kalmady
