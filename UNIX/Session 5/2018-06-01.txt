#11 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay, I think we should start

#12 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: before going to the basic constructs of shell-scripts, we will look at some other basic utility functions in the shell

#13 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: <@UAH30B5KQ> have you come across cal command?

#14 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: <@UAFPA8G59> has joined the channel

#15 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: <@UAH30B5KQ> are you there? <@UAFPA8G59> how can you print today's date and time using a shell command?

#16 User:UAFVAN945
Message: If you guys don't know you can google it:smile:

#17 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: or use the man pages

#18 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: date command?

#19 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay, so the `date` command spits out the current date and time

#20 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: similarly `cal` command will show the calendar of this month and highlight today's date

#21 User:UAGR7CFEJ
Message: <@UAGR7CFEJ> has joined the channel

#22 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: put a thumbs up on the respective messages if you have tried them out on your terminal

#23 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: sorry network problems

#24 User:UAFVAN945
Message: It's alright

#25 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: I assume you guys are familiar with grep command?

#26 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: can you try printing out a number, say "21" from the O/P of cal command?

#27 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: <@UAH07G9T9> has joined the channel

#28 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: like year 21?

#29 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: no, a date 21

#30 User:UAFVAN945
Message: no the date

#31 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay, you can always do `cal | grep "21"`. Can anyone tell me what's the output?

#32 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: not working

#33 User:UAGR7CFEJ
Message: the entire line is printed with 21 in red colour

#34 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: are you sure you keyed in correctly? it's working on my terminl

#35 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: <@UAGR7CFEJ> correct

#36 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: now can you think of the cut command and do something?

#37 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: the cut command selects some portion of the text and prints it out

#38 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: ah yes it worked

#39 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: hint: think of `cut -c n1,n2`

#40 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: in the terminal itself or in a file?

#41 User:UAFVAN945
Message: terminal itself

#42 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Does anyone remember what the '-c' is for?

#43 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: characters

#44 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay, try this : `cal | grep "21" | cut -c 13,14`

#45 User:UAGR7CFEJ
Message: prints 21

#46 User:UAGR7CFEJ
Message: but when I used cal | grep 21 | cut -c 21,22 it gave a different result

#47 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: correct, that's because the characters at positions 21 and 22 are different

#48 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: so, you can see that this is not extendable to different months, because the position of "21" will be different

#49 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: any other ideas?

#50 User:UAFVAN945
Message: The characters in those positions are just spaces

#51 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: how do you delimit using the cut command?

#52 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: the cal has spaces in between numbers right, this could be a start

#53 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: can we print characters,bytes etc of a given range?

#54 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: `cut -d' '`

#55 User:UAFVAN945
Message: thats a good idea

#56 User:UAFVAN945
Message: what would the command be

#57 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: so, this command splits the input based on ' ' and separates them into fields

#58 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: the remaining job is to choose the appropriate field

#59 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: so shall I proceed?

#60 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: `cal | grep "21" | cut -d' ' -f 5` : this prints out 21. Can anyone explain why?

#61 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: 21 is the fifth number in the output

#62 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: more generally, it's the fifth field

#63 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: yeah my bad

#64 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: this is still not the best answer, because we need to know the field of the number in every month

#65 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: what does `grep -o something.txt` do?

#66 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: `cut -c a-b` ?

#67 User:UAGR7CFEJ
Message: cut -c n1-n2

#68 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Anyone?:sweat_smile:

#69 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay the `-o` options prints an O/P iff there exists an exact match

#70 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: so, `cal | grep -o "21"` will print out only 21

#71 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: any doubts so far?

#72 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: something like a search function?

#73 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: I don't understand what you mean by search

#74 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: grep will print the complete line which matches the pattern

#75 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: but -o option will only print the appropriate part, that's the difference

#76 User:UAH8CT90X
Message: <@UAH8CT90X> has joined the channel

#77 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay we will start with the first shell script

#78 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: ohh

#79 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: create a file with ".sh" extension in a directory

#80 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: the extension only helps us find the shell scripts quickly, the OS doesn't differentiate files based on their extensions

#81 User:UAFVAN945
Message: What is the need for shell scripting? Basically if you combine many commands and want to execute many of them one after the other, you would store it in a file and execute them

#82 User:UAFVAN945
Message: This ".sh" file is called a script. Since you have shell commands, it's called shell script.

#83 User:UAFVAN945
Message: So instead of entering each command on the terminal, you can have it all in a file.

#84 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Understood?

#85 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay, at the beginning of the script, you need to tell the OS what interpreter to use

#86 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: we can write scripts using python, perl. bash, etc.

#87 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: that's why we use a shebang - `#!/bin/bash`

#88 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Any doubts?

#89 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: the shebang line indicates that we are using the bash interpreter, which can be found at the folder /bin/

#90 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: it could also be `#!/usr/bin/perl`, `#!/usr/bin/python`, etc for different scripts

#91 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: but if it is not specified, it will assume bash to be the default interpreter

#92 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: is everyone with me?

#93 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Anyone knows what 'bash' stands for?

#94 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: bourne again shell

#95 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay, inside the file enter: `echo "This is my first shell script"`

#96 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay, to make a file, there are many ways

#97 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: `touch filename`, will create a file name, but does not open it

#98 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: more easily, `subl filename`, `vi filename` will create and open the file

#99 User:UAFVAN945
Message: 'subl' is for an editor called Sublime text that you need to explicitly download. But guys it's worth it. Do download it after the session

#100 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: does it replace vim?

#101 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: it's an alternative

#102 User:UAFVAN945
Message: it doesn't replace it, its another editor

#103 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: oh so you can use both ?

#104 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: but many find vi to be the most productive  editor

#105 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: yeah, you can always use both. it's used for writing programs

#106 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: i want sublime but idk if it will work for wsl

#107 User:UAFVAN945
Message: I like sublime better:yum:

#108 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: <@UAH07G9T9> can enlighten us on the greatness of vim, I would love to have a session

#109 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay, you guys entered an echo statement inside the scrpt?

#110 User:UAFVAN945
Message: If you have any doubts please feel free to ask us

#111 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay, now the file can be run as `bash filename`

#112 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: but, the file does not have the execute permission, so we can't run it as `./filename`

#113 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: every file has an attribute called permissions

#114 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: the `ls -l` lists out the permissions in the first column

#115 User:UAFVAN945
Message: the "rwx" denotes the permissions

#116 User:UAFVAN945
Message: so there user, group and others

#117 User:UAFVAN945
Message: We can change the permissions using the "chmod" command

#118 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: we can use chmod to change file permissions

#119 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: so, to be able to execute a file, it needs to have execute permission for the current user

#120 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: `chmod +x filename` will give the execute access

#121 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: any doubts?

#122 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: now, you can execute the script as ./filename also

#123 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: previously, you would have got a `permission denied` message

#124 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay, moving on, let's look at the basics of if-else constructs

#125 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: you can look at the syntax here - <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/if-elif-statement.htm>

#126 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: basically, the condition to be evaluated is placed within the square braces

#127 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: the reason is, the if stmt, by itself cannot evaluate relational and logical expressions

#128 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: so, we can use another stmt called `test` to evaluate the conditional statements

#129 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: the programs look a little like C#

#130 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: or, equivalently use `[]`

#131 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: importantly, the spaces inside the `[]` are very important, and must be preserved as is

#132 User:UAFVAN945
Message: yeah it does, but the spacing is crucial for it to work

#133 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: so `if [expression 1]` is invalid?

#134 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: how will the syntax be for this case?

#135 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay, how do you know how many arguments have been passed to the script?

#136 User:UAFVAN945
Message: 'test' works for comparing two numbers, two strings and file attributes.

#137 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: test val1 operator val2

#138 User:UAFVAN945
Message: if test $1 -gt 0
then
echo "$1 number is positive"

#139 User:UAFVAN945
Message: I want you to try it out and tell me:joy:

#140 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: so, shell scripting has something called special variables, which come in very handy, while writing shell scripts - <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-special-variables.htm>

#141 User:UAFVAN945
Message: instead of the relational operators ==,&lt;=,&gt;=,&gt;,&lt;,!= that u use in C, shell uses -eq(equal),-le(less than or eq),-ge,-gt,lt,-ne etc

#142 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: is test a command?

#143 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: or just a keyword

#144 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: so, the number of args passed to our script can be accessed via the variable `$#`

#145 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: similarly, the first arg is placed in $1, second arg is contained in $2, etc

#146 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: everyone clear?

#147 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: <@UAFHUCYAG> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/UAFHUCYAG/FB0UR003Y/-.sh|Untitled>

#148 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: the if construct always ends with `fi`

#149 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: `-eq` checks if the two args are equal

#150 User:UAFVAN945
Message: fi is like the '}' that you learnt in C

#151 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: it showed `./sample.sh: line 3: [10==15]: command not found`

#152 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: <@UAFHUCYAG> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/UAFHUCYAG/FAZRBRXRS/elif_construct.sh|elif construct>

#153 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay, can you guys code up to print out the max of two numbers?


#155 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: or, do you guys know how to read numbers from STDIN?

#156 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay, the `read` command is used to input a number

#157 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: you can read two numbers instead of passing as args, and store them inside variables

#158 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: like `read $a` ?

#159 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: no, `read a` should suffice

#160 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: what do we use for parentheses?

#161 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: The syntax does not need parenthesis in the read command

#162 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay any doubts?

#163 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: no i mean how to type nested if statements?

#164 User:UAFVAN945
Message: the then and fi you can say are equivalent to '{' and '}' respectively

#165 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: the syntax is not too different for nested-if, this contains a simple example - <https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/nestedifthen.html>

#166 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: we will wrap up for today

#167 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: shoud the indentation be 2 spaces? because i am getting an error when im executing the file

#168 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: ./myscript.sh: line 6: syntax error near unexpected token `then'
./myscript.sh: line 6: `then'

#169 User:UAFVAN945
Message: no it is a single space

#170 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: ok

#171 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Guys so your first assignment would be to read in 3 values from the user, find the sum as well as the greatest of the 3.

#172 User:UAH8CT90X
Message: okay

#173 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Great job you guys!

#174 User:UAFVAN945
