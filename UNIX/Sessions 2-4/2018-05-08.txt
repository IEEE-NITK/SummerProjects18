#4 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Ok guys

#5 User:UAFVAN945
Message: lets start:grin:

#6 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Did you guys complete the tasks that were given in the mail?

#7 User:UAFU0J1K5

#8 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: i did not receive mail

#9 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Ok, don't worry we will sort this out after the session

#10 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFU0J1K5> do you know the answer to the first question?

#11 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: yeah

#12 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Here are a set of tasks for the next session as a recap of the first one:-
1) Find out the difference between UNIX and LINUX.
2) Create a directory called "Unix project" (without quotes) in your home directory.
3) Go into that directory and create a text file using 'cat' command and write some text into it. 
4) Now delete this entire directory(along with that file of course).

#13 User:UAFU0J1K5
Message: Linux is a unix clone

#14 User:UAFVAN945
Message: good

#15 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Anything else you would like to add?

#16 User:UAFU0J1K5
Message: Linux is portable whereas unix is not

#17 User:UAFVAN945
Message: That's right

#18 User:UAFVAN945
Message: LINUX is basically open source, while UNIX is proprietary software.

#19 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: Linux is used in home based pcs while unix is used in server system

#20 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Linux is developed by Open Source development i.e. through sharing and collaboration of code and features through forums etc and it is distributed by various vendors.

Unix systems are divided into various other flavors, mostly developed by AT&amp;T as well as various commercial vendors and non-profit organizations.

#21 User:UAFVAN945
Message: You can check out the source code here: <https://github.com/torvalds/linux>

#22 User:UAFVAN945
Message: So I'd like to give you a little bit of backstory about Linux.

#23 User:UAFVAN945
Message: To learn about how Linux came to be, let’s go back to the beginning to 1969 where Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories developed the UNIX operating system. It was later rewritten in C to make it more portable and eventually became a widely used operating system.

#24 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Almost a decade later Richard Stallman started working on the GNU (GNU is Not UNIX) project, the GNU kernel called Hurd, which unfortunately never came to completion. The GNU General Public License (GPL), a free software license, was also created as a result of this.

#25 User:UAFVAN945
Message: The *kernel* is the most important piece in the operating system. It allows the hardware to talk to the software. It also does a whole lot of other things, but we’ll discuss that in the upcoming sessions. For now, just know that the kernel controls pretty much everything that happens on your system.

#26 User:UAFVAN945
Message: During this time other efforts such as BSD, MINIX, etc were developed to be UNIX like-systems. However, one thing that all these UNIX like-systems had in common was the lack of a unified kernel. Then in 1991, a young fellow named _Linus Torvalds_ started developing what we now know today as the Linux kernel.

#27 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Interesting right?

#28 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Ok so the next question: Create a directory called "Unix project" (without quotes) in your home directory.

#29 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Does anyone know to do to this?

#30 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: By using mkdir command

#31 User:UAFVAN945
Message: correct but did you say mkdir Unix project?

#32 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: mkdir Unix/ project

#33 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: Nope

#34 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Can you tell me the exact command you used?

#35 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Did you try executing this command with the forward slash?

#36 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Ok so I want everyone to execute the following commands and tell me what output you get

#37 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: I don't know

#38 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: sorry its forward slash

#39 User:UAFVAN945
Message: It's alright

#40 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFVAN945> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/UAFVAN945/FALCRCC85/-.txt|Untitled>

#41 User:UAFVAN945
Message: put a thumbs up on the snippet once you're done

#42 User:UAGR3HCLW
Message: it creates a directory smp in desktop and goes into the directory

#43 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Thats correct:smiley:

#44 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Now I want you guys to try to make a directory called "Unix project" using the mkdir command

#45 User:UAFVAN945
Message: After that using the 'ls' command I want you to tell me what happens

#46 User:UAGR3HCLW
Message: directory is empty

#47 User:UAGR3HCLW
Message: so it doesn

#48 User:UAGR3HCLW
Message: do anything

#49 User:UAFVAN945
Message: did you use the 'mkdir' command?

#50 User:UAGTJ7M8X
Message: It is making two empty directory's Unix and project

#51 User:UAGR3HCLW
Message: oh i used double quotes

#52 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Ok good

#53 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFVAN945> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/UAFVAN945/FAKHS8MJ4/2_directories_created.txt|2 directories created>

#54 User:UAFU0J1K5
Message: It makes two different directories

#55 User:UAFVAN945
Message: this command results in the creation of 2 directories like some of you have seen

#56 User:UAFVAN945
Message: What we want is a directory called "Unix project"

#57 User:UAFVAN945
Message: to get that we need to use the command

#58 User:UAFVAN945

#59 User:USLACKBOT
Message: This message was deleted.

#60 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: I think

#61 User:UAFVAN945
Message: 'cd' is used to change directories.

#62 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: Ok

#63 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Now when you use the 'ls' command you should see a single directory named "Unix project"

#64 User:UAFVAN945
Message: The same result can be obtained even if you say

#65 User:UAFVAN945

#66 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Any doubts so far?

#67 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: no

#68 User:UAFVAN945
Message: ok so moving on

#69 User:UAFVAN945
Message: 3) Go into that directory and create a text file using 'cat' command and write the text "Hello World!" into it.

#70 User:UAFVAN945
Message: What's the command to change directory?

#71 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: Cd

#72 User:UAFVAN945
Message: that is correct, but ensure it is in lowercase though

#73 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: Yeah..

#74 User:UAFVAN945
Message: otherwise you will get an error saying "command not found"

#75 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: Ok

#76 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFVAN945> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/UAFVAN945/FAMAKFD63/try_this_out.txt|Try this out>

#77 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Then press Ctrl+d

#78 User:UAFU0J1K5
Message: Can we use ctrl z

#79 User:UAFVAN945
Message: You can but what this does is it just pauses the current process

#80 User:UAFVAN945
Message: This is not advisable.

#81 User:UAFVAN945
Message: 'fg' command can then be used to resume it

#82 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Did you all try it out?

#83 User:UAFU0J1K5
Message: Ok

#84 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: (cat a.txt &gt; b.txt) and (cp a.txt b.txt) are same??

#85 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Yes, it is essentially performing the same operation. In the first case your taking the output of one and writing that into b.txt and in the second you are using the copy function

#86 User:UAFVAN945
Message: So do any of you know why we use Ctrl+d?

#87 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: To come out from the text file

#88 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: save and exit?

#89 User:UAFVAN945
Message: thats right

#90 User:UAFVAN945
Message: ^d is an End of file character. Once that is encountered, the file writing is complete.

#91 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: Althout it performs the same function here you should know that the two commands are used for completely different purposes.

#92 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Let's learn a few more essential commands

#93 User:UAFVAN945
Message: This week is all about the basics, but they are very essential commands

#94 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: Can you tell me how to reopen it

#95 User:UAFVAN945
Message: to view the file you have created, use "cat a.txt"

#96 User:UAFVAN945
Message: modifications can't be made though using the cat command

#97 User:UAFVAN945
Message: you can append text at the end of the file using the command "cat &gt;&gt; a.txt"

#98 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: we can open the file in editor and make changes. right?

#99 User:UAFVAN945
Message: I'll teach you few tricks which you will definitely find they come in handy

#100 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: gedit a.txt

#101 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: Okay....thanks

#102 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: like this

#103 User:UAFVAN945
Message: yup we'll be teaching you this next week:grin:

#104 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: ok:sweat_smile:

#105 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Ok so moving on to a command that you will be super grateful very soon is the "history" command

#106 User:UAFVAN945
Message: In your shell, there is a history of the commands that you previously entered, you can actually look through these commands. This is quite useful when you want to find and run a command you used previously without actually typing it again.

#107 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFVAN945> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/UAFVAN945/FAM6AQ4S2/try_this.txt|try this>

#108 User:UAFVAN945
Message: to run the same command you did before, just hit the up arrow.

#109 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Want to run the previous command without typing it again? Use !!. If you typed cat a.txt and want to run it again, you can actually just go '!!' and it will run the last command you ran.

#110 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Another history shortcut is ctrl-R, this is the reverse search command, if you hit ctrl-R on the terminal and you start typing parts of the command you want it will show you matches and you can just navigate through them by hitting the ctrl-R key again. Once you found the command you want to use again, just hit the Enter key.

#111 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Guys I do hope you make a note of these commands

#112 User:UAFVAN945
Message: cool right?:joy:

#113 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Do you guys want a 5 min break?:sweat_smile:

#114 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: as you wish. we're fine

#115 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: :laughing:

#116 User:UAFVAN945
Message: So before we proceed

#117 User:UAFVAN945
Message: I want to tell you guys about the result of using - ^d, ^z, ^c after you enter some text using the cat command

#118 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFL06YEM> what was the ^d command for?

#119 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: To come out from the text file

#120 User:UAFVAN945
Message: right

#121 User:UAFVAN945
Message: ctrl+D is used to quit the current action.

#122 User:UAFVAN945
Message: ctrl+c kills the current process which is the process of writing into the file.

#123 User:UAFVAN945
Message: ctrl+z is used to pause the current process. 'fg' command can then be used to resume it

#124 User:UAFVAN945
Message: This method is not recommended though

#125 User:UAFVAN945
Message: understood?

#126 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: capital D?

#127 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: fg is to resume in the foreground right

#128 User:UAFVAN945
Message: When you feel like your terminal is getting a little cluttered, you can do a little cleanup, using the clear command to clear up your display.

#129 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFVAN945> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/UAFVAN945/FAKJPDS8Y/clears_the_screen.txt|Clears the screen>

#130 User:UAFVAN945
Message: The next one is really really useful:sweat_smile:

#131 User:UAFVAN945
Message: One of the most useful features in any command-line environment is tab completion. If you start typing the beginning of a command, file, directory, etc and hit the Tab key, it will autocomplete based on what it finds in the directory you are searching as long as you don’t have any other files that start with those letters.

#132 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: rmdir?

#133 User:UAFVAN945
Message: that is useful too

#134 User:UAFVAN945
Message: all of you are in the Unix project directory with a text file called a.txt right?

#135 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: Yeah

#136 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: why does a backslash come at the end?

#137 User:UAFVAN945
Message: whats the command you tried out

#138 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: when you use tab

#139 User:UAFVAN945
Message: I want you guys to enter "cat a" then hit the tab key

#140 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: a backslash comes at the end right

#141 User:UAFVAN945
Message: you get a forward slash right?

#142 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: a.txt came automatically

#143 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: / is the slash

#144 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Exactly!!

#145 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Yup thats the forward slash

#146 User:UAH30B5KQ
Message: my bad

#147 User:UAFVAN945
Message: I'm not too sure but I think its to denote that its a directory

#148 User:UAFVAN945
Message: It's going to come in handy soon, you won't have to waste time entering the entire name of a file ever again:grin:

#149 User:UAFVAN945
Message: So the last command I want to teach you guys this session is the remove function

#150 User:UAFVAN945
Message: we have created a directory now lets learn how to remove it too

#151 User:UAFVAN945
Message: To remove files you can use the rm command. The rm (remove) command is used to delete files and directories.


#153 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Take caution when using rm,as once they are gone, they are gone for good, so be careful.

#154 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Fortunately there are some safety measures put into place, so you can’t just remove a bunch of important files. Write-protected files will prompt you for confirmation before deleting them. If a directory is write-protected it will also not be easily removed.

#155 User:UAFVAN945
Message: guys I want you to execute the following commands and tell me what you get

#156 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFVAN945> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/UAFVAN945/FALE527L5/-.txt|Untitled>

#157 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: cannot remove. its a directory


#159 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: this is the output


#161 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: Yeah

#162 User:UAFVAN945
Message: the cd.. command takes you to the parent directory

#163 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFL06YEM> can you execute the command "cd Desktop/SMP"

#164 User:UAFVAN945
Message: then "rm Unix\ project"

#165 User:UAFVAN945
Message: Since the directory "Unix project" has a file present in it, you won't be able to remove it just like that. You need to enter the command:

#166 User:UAFVAN945
Message: <@UAFVAN945> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/UAFVAN945/FALA8FNGJ/to_remove_the_directory.txt|To remove the directory>

#167 User:UAFVAN945
Message: The -r flag recursively removes all the files and any subdirectories of the specified directory

#168 User:UAFVAN945
Message: no small case:sweat_smile:

#169 User:UAFVAN945
Message: That's all for todays session guys

#170 User:UAFLHAB2M
Message: thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
