#16 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: do all of you have a terminal to begin with?

#17 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: it would be nice to explore the commands on the go. Please make sure you have this for future sessions atleast

#18 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: most of what I cover today, is what you already know

#19 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay, can anyone tell me what ls does?

#20 User:UAF4ZQ7BJ
Message: what is the full form?

#21 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: list is the full form of ls

#22 User:UAF4ZQ7BJ
Message: oh my bad. Yes ls lists all the files in the present directory

#23 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: there are tons of other options that can be used along with ls

#24 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: for instance:

#25 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: <@UAGTJ7M8X> can you tell me what ls -l does?

#26 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: how is it different from the barebones ls?

#27 User:UAGTJ7M8X
Message: It gives a long formate like it include last time used etc

#28 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: yeah. more precisely, it mentions the size, permissions, modified date and time, owner of the file, etc.

#29 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: To see the filesize in human readable format, we can use ls -lh command

#30 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: <@UAGR7CFEJ> what does ls -a do?

#31 User:UAF4ZQ7BJ
Message: sorry but what is barebones?

#32 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: -h flag stands for human readable

#33 User:UAFHUCYAG

#38 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: <@UAGR3HCLW> can you tell me what ls -R does? Do this in a directory with subdirectories :stuck_out_tongue:

#39 User:UAGTJ7M8X
Message: Even LS -a mentions current and prarent directory's

#40 User:UAGR3HCLW
Message: lists recursively directory tree

#41 User:UAGTJ7M8X
Message: Also

#42 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: yeah. Folders might contain many hidden files (usually beginning with a dot in their names, like .bashrc, .vimrc, .profile) etc.

#43 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: yeah, correct

#44 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: A better way to visualize the directory structure is by using tree command. But you will have to install the program in the first place

#45 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay, let's move onto the cd command

#46 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: cd as you know, is used to change the working directory

#47 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: you all must check out zsh terminal

#48 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: there's a nice plugin called oh-my-zsh also

#49 User:UAFHUCYAG

#50 User:UAFPA8G59

#51 User:UAFHUCYAG

#52 User:UAFHUCYAG

#53 User:UAFL06YEM
Message: <@UAFL06YEM> has joined the channel

#54 User:UAF9M0XBK
Message: cd~username does that i guess

#55 User:UAFVAN945
Message: It is important that ls is in lowercase as LS isn't a command

#56 User:UAGR3HCLW
Message: cd .. moves up one directory

#57 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: moving to the home directory can be done using "cd ~ "

#58 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: but moving one directory above needs : cd ..

#59 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: yeah

#60 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: how do you move up two directories at a time?

#61 User:UAGR3HCLW
Message: cd ../..

#62 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: yeah, correct

#63 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: As an aside, in the zsh terminal with that plugin, you can directly start typing in the folder name, it will have cached all of the previous working directories. It's a great productivity boost for devs.

#64 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: is everyone with me so far?

#65 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: any doubts?

#66 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: is zsh a separate program

#67 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: you can tell me if I am fast, slow, boring, whatever

#68 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: it's another terminal itself, like bash

#69 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: so we have to install zsh right

#71 User:UAF4ZQ7BJ
Message: Do all terminals need Linux OS?

#72 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: terminal is a program on the linux distributions, which can be used to create, manage and work with other processes

#73 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: now, you have terminals on windows also, apart from mac OSX

#74 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay, moving on. Can anyone tell me what's the different between relative and absolute address?

#75 User:UAGR3HCLW
Message: relative address is dealing with memory locations with respect to another one

#76 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: you can use bash on windows also, but you don't have the freedom to tinker with stuff, like you do in linux

#77 User:UAF9M0XBK
Message: Relative addresses can be diff

#78 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: windows abstracts away a lot of the details from the user

#79 User:UAF9M0XBK
Message: But absolute address is same no matter which directory u working in

#80 User:UAGR3HCLW
Message: like if you have a pointer p pointing to a int and p++ will point to the address + 4bytes

#81 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: correct, absolute addresses are specified from the root directory

#82 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: the relative addresses are specified wrt the current directory

#83 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: I am not sure if the pointers analogy is the best way to describe the situation. Especially, when we have soft links and all

#84 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: you guys can check out what "cd - " does

#85 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: it's used to move directly to the last used directory

#86 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: okay, shall we move on to pwd command?

#87 User:UAGTJ7M8X
Message: S

#88 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: can we use pointers to  access and manipulate these addresses?

#89 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: <@UAFHUCYAG> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/UAFHUCYAG/FAGJCLE13/code_for_pwd.sh|code for pwd>


#91 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: can we type cd ../../ n times to move up n directories?

#92 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: I am not sure I got your question, but yeah that's how it's implemented in the file system

#93 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: the commands to create a file, create soft and hard links, delete a file - all involving storing the addresses of blocks of memory(which together make up a file)

#94 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: storing and playing with the addresses of the blocks

#95 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: but these are not exposed to the user per se, that's why we need an abstraction called a file system


#97 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: so what does pwd do? - spits out the present working directory


#99 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: 4th one gives the home directory i guess


#101 User:UAGR3HCLW
Message: ln: ./a: File exists

#102 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: so the first line will take you to the home directory


#104 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: the second line uses the ln with -s flag. It's used to create a soft link to the directory, which is specified in the first argument

#105 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: the third line moves into the htm directory


#107 User:UAGTJ7M8X
Message: What is soft link

#108 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: I took the pain of creating sym links or soft links to show the difference between -P and -L flags for the pwd command

#109 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: <@UAF4ZQ7BJ> think of a terminal as just another program allowing you to do a bunch of stuff. Back in the day, there was no GUI. No mouse even at one point. So everything was done by issuing a specific set of commands to your computer. Everything from file handling to system management. And all of that was done through an interface called the Command Line Interface(CLI) which we now call the terminal. You can do everything you can do using a GUI on a terminal.

And no. You don't need a Linux OS for a terminal. Every major OS has a terminal, though the instructions you issue and what you can do has its limitations.

#110 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: soft links will be covered in detail in the future sessions. But what can be understood is - two different files can be linked together keeping a single copy of the data on the hard disk

#111 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: For e.g on the windows command line you have `dir` command to list directories and files whereas Linux bash terminals use `ls`

#112 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: something like a pointer?

#113 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: yeah, it's actually a pointer

#114 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: so pwd -L flag will only show the output, without minding the soft links

#115 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: but you will get a different output if you use a -P flag for the pwd command

#116 User:UAF4ZQ7BJ
Message: thanks a lot

#117 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: also, I have used /bin/pwd command in the above snippet because, pwd refers to the shell's implementation of the command

#118 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: but /bin/pwd refers to the specific binary file, which is already present in the system

#119 User:UAH07G9T9
Message:  <@UAFPA8G59> If there are n directories to move up to, then yes.

If you type `ls - a` in any directory it will list all the files and directories including the hidden ones. You will find two files `. ` and `.. `. Here the first one refers to the current directory and the second one to the parent directory.

#120 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: so when you are writing an application, if you don't want your applucation to break, when the bash implementation of pwd is modified, you will want to use binary implementations

#121 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: So you can keep doing `../../..` n number of times because every directory has a `.. ` that points to the parent directory.

#122 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: it's fine if you don't get the soft link part completely, just remember that we have flags to get the resolved path names also

#123 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: everyone is with me till now?

#124 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: Keep asking doubts :D

#125 User:UAF9M0XBK
Message: Ya

#126 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: kinda

#127 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: hmm i see. and how to move down n directories?

#128 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: <@UAFHUCYAG> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/UAFHUCYAG/FAGJNP5K7/cat_command_usage.sh|cat command usage>

#129 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: I want you guys to try out all these commands

#130 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: the -n flag is used to include line numbers when it displays the contents of the files - improves readability

#131 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: <@UAGTJ7M8X> Remember creating a shortcut in windows? Think of it as a something pretty much like that. More details will be given in future sessions.

#132 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: the sixth line shows, how all the output of the cat command can be plummeled into another file. this is very useful

#133 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: <@UAFPA8G59> what's the doubt?

#134 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: for the command shown in the 4th line: we can take input from STDIN (keyboard) until the user hits Ctrl+D. All of that text will be saved into the specified file

#135 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: anything that you didn't understand here?

#136 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: cat is actually used to concatenate files. It concatenates them and prints an o/p

#137 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: What he's trying to say is, if you application uses the pwd command, if the version that bash uses is modified then your application might break. So we specifically tell it use the binary at /bin/pwd

#138 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: I've to look up some of this in order to get a clear picture that's all

#139 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: give me a thumbs up if you have understood.

#140 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: Yeah. Just raise doubts in the Google group if some doubt pops up. It's usually a bit murky in the beginning



#143 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: Create file with some dummy content first. And then run those commands.

#144 User:UAGTJ7M8X
Message: no










#154 User:UAFVAN945
Message: cat is for display

#155 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: OK small question for you guys

#156 User:UAFVAN945
Message: You could also say cat &lt; filename

#157 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: Let's say you have a file file1.txt with some text in it. There's another file file2.txt. How would you append the contents of file1.txt at the end of file2.txt?


#159 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: Move down as in?

#160 User:UAGR3HCLW
Message: cat file2.txt file1.txt




#164 User:UAGTJ7M8X
Message: is third command changes any of file original contents

#165 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: Are you sure? Wouldn't that just print the contents of file1 and then file2?
Read the question again

#166 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: it overwrites them

#167 User:UAGTJ7M8X
Message: means

#168 User:UAFVAN945
Message: deletes the current content and adds the new one

#169 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: whatever was wriiten in the file at first will be replaced with whatever u just typed

#170 User:UAGTJ7M8X
Message: ohh

#171 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: So
`cat file1&gt;file2` will overwrite file2 with contents of file1

`cat file1&gt;&gt;file2` will append contents of file2 at the end of file1.


This is best seen when you type them out in a terminal yourself. So at the end of this I want all of you to run all of these on your terminals and to confirm the functionalities. You can raise doubts if something doesn't look right.

#176 User:UAFHUCYAG

#177 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: cat file2&gt;&gt;file

#178 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: or shall we call it a day?

#179 User:UAGTJ7M8X
Message: cat file1.txt file2.txt &gt;&gt;file2.txt

#180 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: What would that do? Can you go through it one by one by breaking it down?

#181 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: Sure? :p

#182 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: pretty sure

#183 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: I want to add thing to the end of file2, so should file2 be on the left of the &gt;&gt; or the right?

#184 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: left

#185 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: Also, when you see something like `command file1 &gt; file2`

contents of file1 will be used by the command and the output will be written to file2 by overwriting the current contents of file2. Cool?

#186 User:UAGTJ7M8X
Message: its actually cat file1.txt &gt;&gt;file2.txt

#187 User:UAGTJ7M8X
Message: s

#188 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: oh that's a good way to remember

#189 User:UAGR3HCLW
Message: cat file1&gt;&gt;file2 appends file1 to file2 right?

#190 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: The answer is `cat file1.txt&gt;&gt;file2.txt`

Breaking it down

`cat file1.txt` display content so file1.txt.
`cat file1.txt &gt;&gt;file2.txt` display contents of file1.txt and redirect it to the end of file2.txt (append)

#191 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: <@UAGR3HCLW> you are right.

#192 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: oh its the reverse

#193 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: `&gt;` is known as the redirection. If you notice cat only displays the output. The reason it gets added to file2 is because you `redirect` the output there?

#194 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: So if you break down the command `cat file1 &gt; file2`

It's actually made of two parts.

First part `cat file1` displays contents of file1

Second part `&gt; file2` redirect output of the command that preceded the `&gt;` to file2

#195 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: So you can actually do `ls&gt;file2`

#196 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: What do you think that will do?

#197 User:UAGTJ7M8X
Message: write the output given by ls to file

#198 User:UAFPA8G59
Message: yeah same

#199 User:UAH07G9T9
Message: Perfect. So next time you see a `&gt;`you should realize it just means take the output from what preceeded `&gt;` and redirect it to the file specified after `&gt;`

Message: Guys you can ping any of us if you have any doubts, you could post them either here or on the google group

#209 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: also, regarding the working of rm command, rm will only unlink the associated data from the file name in the filesystem, and it marks the associated space as usable on the device. We won't actually get rid of the data on the disk

#210 User:UAFHUCYAG
Message: so, to remove stuff like your browser history, use shred command instead. This will overwrite all of the data on the disk, and so it can't be reconstructed again also.

#211 User:UAH07G9T9

#212 User:UAFHUCYAG
