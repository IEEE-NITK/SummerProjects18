Message: So is everyone ready??

#1 User:Adil Ashique
Message: We shall  start in a minute or two.  We will wait for the rest for a few minutes.

#2 User:Adil Ashique
Message: So before we start I want you guys to do  a quick thing,  we need a second text file for this session. So go into the terminal and open up the unix-smp directory

#3 User:Adil Ashique
Message: <@Adil Ashique> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/Adil Ashique/FAUBW9WRM/-.sh|Untitled>

#4 User:Adil Ashique
Message: the space between lazy and dog must be a tab

#5 User:Adil Ashique
Message: tell me once you have done this

#6 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: this basically puts it in sample.txt right?

#7 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Yes thats what it does.

#8 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Its copies down the text into the file that we have specified

#9 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: tab is not working

#10 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: i used two spaces instead

#11 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Or you can go into the text file and press tab between both

#12 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: oh ok

#13 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Okay so now last session we covered a few text manipulation commands now we shall continue with them.

#14 User:Adil Ashique
Message: First command we'll be learning about is the cut command. It extracts portions of text from a file.

#15 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Now execute this command

#16 User:Adil Ashique
Message: <@Adil Ashique> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/Adil Ashique/FAU7ET5C6/-.sh|Untitled>

#17 User:Adil Ashique
Message: What do you get?

#18 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: the fifth character?

#19 User:Adil Ashique
Message: correct

#20 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: only q

#21 User:Adil Ashique
Message: So as you found out ,this outputs the 5th character in each line of the file. In this case it is "q", note that the space also counts as a character.

#22 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Now execute this

#23 User:Adil Ashique
Message: <@Adil Ashique> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/Adil Ashique/FASQ2MGE5/-.sh|Untitled>

#24 User:Adil Ashique
Message: What do you get?

#25 User:Adil Ashique
Message: And why?

#26 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: the sentence

#27 User:Yash Khivasara
Message: complete sentence as it is

#28 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Are you sure you put a tab space before dog

#29 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: i am only getting dog

#30 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: but i dont know why

#31 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Yes if you are getting Dog its the right answer

#32 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: yeah i got dog

#33 User:Adil Ashique
Message: the others put a tab space before dog and re execute it

#34 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: i guess it considers tab to be the start of the 2nd line so it prints whatever is in the second line

#35 User:Adil Ashique
Message: You are kinda right

#36 User:Anusha Misra
Message: Got dog too

#37 User:Adil Ashique
Message: So the reason why we got the above output is because we extract the contents by a field

#38 User:Adil Ashique
Message: The -f or field flag cuts text based off of fields, by default it uses TABs as delimiters, so everything separated by a TAB is considered a field. You should see "dog" as your output.

#39 User:Adil Ashique
Message: We use 2 here to print the second feild

#40 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Got it?

#41 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: what's a field?

#42 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Now try this one out and tell the output

#43 User:Adil Ashique
Message: <@Adil Ashique> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/Adil Ashique/FASQ72AAV/-.sh|Untitled>


#45 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Yes exactly and do youknow why?

#46 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: -d tells that ; is a delimiter

#47 User:Adil Ashique
Message: yes

#48 User:Anusha Misra
Message: ; is now the delimiter

#49 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: 1 for the first field, -d means everything before the delimiter

#50 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Now what we did here is that we  changed the TAB delimiter to a ";" delimiter and since we are cutting the first field, the result should be "The quick brown".

#51 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Yes all of you are right

#52 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Now consider the first command I asked to execute

#53 User:Adil Ashique
Message: instead of 5 what will happen if we use -5

#54 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: everything before the nth character

#55 User:Yash Khivasara
Message: The q

#56 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: prints till the 5th character

#57 User:Adil Ashique
Message: So as Nakul and Abhinav pointed out all  the charcter before the 5th charcter will be printed i.e when we use minus all the characters before the nth character will be printed.

#58 User:Adil Ashique
Message: So that about it for cut. Any doubts? If not we will move on to the  next command

#59 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Ok now we will go into tr or the translate command.

#60 User:Adil Ashique
Message: The tr (translate) command allows you to translate a set of characters into another set of characters.

#61 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Now try this out

#62 User:Adil Ashique
Message: <@Adil Ashique> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/Adil Ashique/FATAZRQ3C/-.sh|Untitled>

#63 User:Adil Ashique
Message: What is the output?

#64 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: HELLO

#65 User:Anusha Misra
Message: HELLO

#66 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Yes, thats correct.  Great job

#67 User:Anusha Misra
Message: so this works like define in C?

#68 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Actually no. There a particular string that you define is replaced  by a number or function that you give it. Here tr is used to translate the world into another. In  the above example we translated all lower case characters to uppercase <http://characters.As|characters.As> you can see we made the ranges of a-z into A-Z and all text we type that is lowercase gets uppercased.

#69 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Everybody clear with that?

#70 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Okay now the next command that we will look into is the paste command.

#71 User:Adil Ashique
Message: So do you guys still have the older version of the sample.txt .The one we used last session.

#72 User:Adil Ashique
Message: If not delete this one  and download the other one into the unix-smp directory

#73 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Tell me  when you are ready

#74 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: the grocery list one right?

#75 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Ok now the paste command is similar to the cat command, it merges lines together in a file.

#76 User:Adil Ashique
Message: so execute the following two commands and tell me the difference

#77 User:Adil Ashique
Message: <@Adil Ashique> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/Adil Ashique/FASQPSG6M/-.sh|Untitled>

#78 User:Adil Ashique
Message: <@Adil Ashique> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/Adil Ashique/FASQQ458R/-.lua|Untitled>

#79 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Guys got it?

#80 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: Fred appBetty limes 14lons 2

#81 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: for the first command

#82 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: Betty limes 14lons 2

#83 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: for 2nd command

#84 User:Adil Ashique
Message: So what is the difference that you find?

#85 User:Adil Ashique
Message: So I will explain  the two commands

#86 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Now in the first command, default delimiter for paste is TAB, so now there is one line with TABs separating each word. In the second command we changed this delimiter (-d) to space. Now everything should be on one line delimited by spaces.

#87 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Any doubts?

#88 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Guys are you paying attention because I don't see any response from you or is something thats covered hard to understand?

#89 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: is the last line separated with tabs?

#90 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: My net is shitty so i cant respond on time xD

#91 User:Adil Ashique
Message: For which command?

#92 User:Anusha Misra
Message: I'm a little confused so I'm just letting it settle in

#93 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: the first command

#94 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Oh cool XD <@Nakul Suresh>, if you have doubts do ask <@Anusha Misra>

#95 User:Adil Ashique
Message: We are in no hurry

#96 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: why doesnt it print the first line fully?

#97 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: then it directly jumps to the last line?

#98 User:Anusha Misra
Message: So paste works the same way as cat does, the only difference being the delimiter stuff, is it?

#99 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Like here all the lines must be separated by a tab. I'm not quite sure why your first line is not printed ,because it is coming for me.

#100 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Yes exactly.

#101 User:Abhinav P Y
Message: ok

#102 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Okay so now we will go into the next command that is the sort command

#103 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: so is paste a more powerful version of cat?

#104 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Now as the name suggests the sort command sorts lines in the alphabetical order.

#105 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Execute the following command

#106 User:Adil Ashique
Message: <@Adil Ashique> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/Adil Ashique/FATBPU602/-.java|Untitled>

#107 User:Adil Ashique
Message: You do get the lines in a sorted fashion don't you?

#108 User:Adil Ashique
Message: By powerful what do you mean?

#109 User:Adil Ashique
Message: See basically cat print down the file  as it is , but what paste does is it past all the lines one after the other into a single line. Also there is a provision to change the delimiter in paste.

#110 User:Adil Ashique
Message: okay then try out this

#111 User:Adil Ashique
Message: <@Adil Ashique> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/Adil Ashique/FATBTPVL2/-.sh|Untitled>


#113 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: i mean with more options for pasting?

#114 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Exactly using the -r reverses the sort command

#115 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Yes in a way you can say that

#116 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Thats about it for the sort command. Any doubts?

#117 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Okay now the next command that we will be looking into will be the sed command

#118 User:Adil Ashique
Message: The Linux operating system makes use of terminal commands to work with a computer's file system. The primary use of the Linux command sed, which is short for stream editor, is to modify each line of a file or stream by replacing specified parts of the line.

#119 User:Adil Ashique
Message: For example try out this one

#120 User:Adil Ashique
Message: <@Adil Ashique> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/Adil Ashique/FAT91B3M1/-.sh|Untitled>

#121 User:Adil Ashique
Message: What does it do?

#122 User:Yash Khivasara
Message: replaces 12 with 30

#123 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: the contents of sample2 got replaced with those of sample

#124 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Actually the contents in sample2 is the same except that all the 12 are replaced by 30

#125 User:Adil Ashique
Message: So what we did here was that all the 12 in sampl is replaced by 30 into a new file called sample2

#126 User:Adil Ashique
Message: got it?

#127 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: oh all right got it

#128 User:Adil Ashique
Message: So what we did here was making text substitutions with sed. This is one of its main functons.

#129 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: so somewhat like command-line text editing?

#130 User:Adil Ashique
Message: It is also used in another function which we will see in the following example.

#131 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Yes that is is what text manipulation  is all about basically.

#132 User:Adil Ashique
Message: <@Adil Ashique> uploaded a file: <https://ieeeunixsmp.slack.com/files/Adil Ashique/FAT5EHACU/-.sh|Untitled>

#133 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Tell what do you get here?

#134 User:Nakul Suresh
Message: prints only the lines with mark

#135 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Yes exactly. Good job.

#136 User:Adil Ashique
Message: So what we did in this command was that we used it to filter the lines into the other text file

#137 User:Adil Ashique
Message: that is the second use of sed command i.e to  filter the content.

#138 User:Adil Ashique
Message: Is that clear?

#139 User:Adil Ashique
Message: So thats it for this session and with that we  come to an end with text manipulation . Thank you guys. Hope you felt the session to be informative and helpful
